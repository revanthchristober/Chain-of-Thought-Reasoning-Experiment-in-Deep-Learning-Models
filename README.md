# **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Deep Learning Models**

This repository contains a project demonstrating the implementation and evaluation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in deep learning models. The project includes synthetic data generation, model training, evaluation, and analysis.

## **Introduction**

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is an approach to enhance the interpretability and performance of deep learning models. This project demonstrates a complete workflow for implementing CoT reasoning, including data generation, model training, evaluation, and result analysis.

## **Setup and Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chain-of-Thought-Reasoning.git
   cd Chain-of-Thought-Reasoning
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

### Generate Synthetic Data

Run the following script to generate synthetic data:
```bash
python data/generate_data.py
```

### Run Experiments

Open the `experiments.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run all cells to execute the experiments:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/experiments.ipynb
```

This notebook will load the data, train the model, evaluate it, and save the results in the `results` directory.

## **Results**

The results of the experiments, including plots for training loss and predictions vs. actual values, will be saved in the `results/analysis_plots` directory.
